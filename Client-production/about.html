        We created this application as a replacement for other quiz applications which provide anonymity, such as Kahoot.  MamkLearn provides all of the features of other interactive quiz applications in addition to unique ideas such as the time dash game mode. We also give users the opportunity to create their own custom character. All data is handled with safety, and because we use google OAuth tokens, we have no access to any user data besides the name of your email.
        <br />Authors: This application was created by Ilya Strugatskiy and Nabeel Rizk.
